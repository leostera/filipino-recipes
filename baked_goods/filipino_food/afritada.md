- 1-2 Tbsp olive oil
- 1.5 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs, salted and patted dry, cut into 1.5" cubes
- 1 yellow onion, chopped
- 1 Tbsp minced garlic

- 2 large carrots, chopped

## directions

1. Heat the olive oil in a heavy pan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat
1. Brown the chicken in batches, turning over the cubes once one side is brown. Do not overfill the pan, or else the chicken juices will overwhelm the pan, and they will steam instead of browning. Remove the chicken as it browns.
1. In the empty pan, add the onion and a pinch of salt, and saute over medium heat until the onions are translucent (6-7 minutes). Then add the garlic and stir until fragrant (30s).
1. Add the tomatoes and stir until they have broken down a little. Use the juices from the tomatoes to deglaze the pan.
1. Add the tomato sauce + water, red potatoes, and add back the browned chicken. Bring to a boil, and then leave simmering. Cook until potatoes are pierce-able with a fork, 15-20 minutes.
1. Add the carrots and cook until tender.
1. Add the peas and black pepper just before serving. (Leave these out to save leftovers)
1. Serve with rice.
