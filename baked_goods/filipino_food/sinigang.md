## directions

1. In a pot, heat 1 tsp oil on medium-high
1. Add chicken/pork and brown on all sides.
1. Add water, enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, skimming off scum that accumulates on top (I like to use a mesh skimmer). Once broth looks clear, add tomatoes, onions and fish sauce.
1. Lower heat and simmer, covered, for about 1 to 1-1/2 hours or until meat is tender.
1. Add gabi taro and cook for about 6 to 8 minutes or until soft. Add daikon. Continue to simmer for about 2 to 3 minutes. Add long beans. Continue to cook for about 2 minutes. Add eggplant and okra and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes.
1. Add tamarind base into pot and stir until completely dissolved. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
1. Add bok choy and continue to cook for about 1 minute.
1. Serve with rice.
